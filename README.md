## Installation

The application requires a Firebase project, but the configuration files are not included
for privacy purposes, so to get one follow the steps for Android and iOS and add them into the folders
`android/app/` and `ios/`

Create a file called `FIREBASE_CONSTANTS.js` inside the folder `app/utils/`
